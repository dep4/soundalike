    # TAG_NAME is apparently always unset when running a trigger manually, but
    # you can pass a git tag via the "Commit hash" field. Cloud Build seems to
    # pass the tag name via COMMIT_SHA, SHORT_SHA, and REVISION_ID if it pulls
    # the source from GitHub, but these variables instead contain the actual
    # commit hash if the source came from Cloud Source Repositories. To avoid
    # this nonsense, just manually pass the version (e.g. "v0.0.1") via a custom
    # substitution variable.
